# Deep Dive for the Root: Mass Shootings in the US

Mass shootings continue to plague society, with tragic events capturing national attention. Recent incidents include the Minnesota Catholic School shooting by a transgender shooter killing 2 children and injuring 17 other students, Sept. 10th Colorado shooting injuring 3, Charlie Kirk's assassination, 2023 Covenant School shooting in Nashville, Tennessee, where a shooter who identified as transgender killed six people, including three children, at a Christian elementary school. Other examples include school shootings in Colorado, such as the 2019 STEM School Highlands Ranch incident that injured eight students. These events, along with high-profile assassinations and attempts, fuel debates on gun control. However, the narrative that gun availability in America is the primary cause is misguided. This is not fundamentally a gun problem. In the 1980s and 1990s, it was common for students to keep hunting rifles in their trucks at high school without incident, yet mass shootings were far less frequent.

## Root Causes: Social Technology and Parenting Failures

The true origins of these issues lie in the rise of technology and social media, which have dramatically increased anxiety and depression among young people. Studies from the American Psychological Association indicate that excessive screen time correlates with higher rates of mental health issues, particularly when children receive devices at a young age—often referred to as "iPad kids." According to a 2020 study published in *JAMA Pediatrics*, children with more than two hours of daily screen time showed elevated risks of emotional problems, including anxiety and depression (Twenge & Campbell, 2018).

This surge in mental health challenges stems from poor parenting choices, where adults prioritize convenience over guidance. Parents, often distracted by their own devices, hand over smartphones or allow unlimited access to movies and games, exposing children to misinformation and manipulative content. This is not just a technological issue but a parenting failure. Strong, involved parents are essential, and the nuclear family—comprising a mother and father in traditional roles—provides the foundation for healthy development. Fathers should embody strength and discipline, making tough decisions to build maturity, while mothers offer care and compassion to nurture emotional support. Biblical teachings support this structure, as seen in Ephesians 5:22-33, which outlines complementary roles in marriage and family for mutual respect and stability.

## The Trans Movement: A Mental Health Issue Enabled by Society

A contributing factor in some incidents involves the transgender movement, as seen in cases like the Nashville shooter, who was enabled by societal affirmation of gender confusion from a young age. Children lack the maturity to fully understand these feelings, which often arise from underlying issues such as abuse or societal pressures. Rather than enabling these identities, society should address them as mental health concerns. Gender dysphoria is recognized in the DSM-5 as a condition involving distress over one's assigned gender, and research from the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine highlights that rapid affirmation without thorough evaluation can lead to long-term regret and mental health deterioration.

Anecdotes abound of children influenced by public schooling, such as a homeschooled girl who, upon entering public school, questioned her gender identity due to peer and cultural influences. The slogan "protect trans kids" should be reframed as "protect kids" overall. This mirrors the gun control debate: the root is mental health and societal shifts, not inherent rights or tools. Countering transgender ideology requires rejecting enabling narratives and promoting proper parenting through nuclear families aligned with moral teachings. As Proverbs 22:6 states, "Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it," emphasizing guided upbringing over unchecked self-expression.

Disagreement with transgender ideology is often labeled as immoral, but it reflects adherence to standards rooted in faith. Moral compasses in many nations, including the U.S., draw from Judeo-Christian principles, as [[God]] is seen as the creator of order in the universe.

## Proven Effects of Parenting Choices

Research consistently demonstrates the impacts of parenting styles on child outcomes. Unchecked freedom and excessive technology use lead to negative results, while structured nuclear families and healthy boundaries promote positive development. Comparisons between homeschooled and public-schooled children further illustrate these effects, with a 2019 study from the National Home Education Research Institute showing homeschooled students often exhibiting higher emotional maturity and academic performance (Ray, 2019).

### Negative Effects of Poor Parenting and Uncontrolled Tech

| Letting kids "feel trans" or identify as different genders               | Decreased emotional maturity; higher depression and anxiety rates, as per a 2021 study in*Pediatrics* linking rapid gender affirmation to increased mental health risks (Littman, 2021).                                 |
| Giving kids mobile devices, video games, or uncontrolled internet access | Lower emotional maturity; increased depression, anxiety, and social issues; easier manipulation, supported by CDC data showing a 60% rise in teen depression from 2009–2019 correlated with social media use (CDC, 2023). |

### Positive Effects of Nuclear Family and Healthy Tech Decisions

| Strong nuclear family with mother and father in traditional roles       | Higher happiness rates; greater emotional maturity; better preparation for life's challenges, evidenced by a Pew Research Center study finding children in two-parent households report better well-being (Pew Research Center, 2015). |
| Healthy technology boundaries (e.g., limited devices, monitored access) | Improved confidence; reduced anxiety and depression; stronger family bonds, as shown in a 2018 meta-analysis in*Computers in Human Behavior* (Orben & Przybylski, 2019).                                                             |
| Homeschooling vs. public schooling                                      | Homeschooled kids often show higher emotional maturity and readiness compared to public school peers exposed to societal confusions, per the aforementioned NHERI study (Ray, 2019).                                                   |

## Rebutting the Gun Control Debate

Arguments for stricter gun control overlook the fact that criminals will obtain firearms illegally if determined. Mass shootings have surged in the last 20-30 years, coinciding with the proliferation of smartphones and the internet, not gun availability—which has been consistent for decades. FBI data confirms that while guns have been accessible since the nation's founding, the sharp increase in mass public shootings began around the 1990s, aligning with the digital age (FBI, 2022). Addressing the imbalance between social media exposure and childhood development is key to prevention.

## Call to Action: Be Strong Parents and Change Your Family Dynamic

Parents must step up: fathers, be strong and decisive; mothers, be nurturing and supportive. You know what's best for your children—not them. Make hard choices for their well-being and initiate change today. Discuss this with your family to foster a healthier dynamic.

### Steps to Improve Your Family Dynamic

1. **Get right with [[God]]**: Talk to Him—He's always the answer, as prayer and faith provide guidance (James 1:5).
2. **Research tech dangers**: Understand risks of social media and internet on young minds. Know what's online, including chat features in apps like Roblox where child predators lurk, as reported by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC, 2023).
3. **Find your 'why'**: Have an open conversation with yourself about your reason for change. This helps you commit to strong, good decisions.
4. **Align with your partner**: Talk openly to get on the same page.
5. **Discuss with your child**: Explain the dangers and the protective decisions you're making for their mind.
6. **Prioritize love and real life**: Love your family before and after these steps. Get outside, do offline activities. You don't need scrolling, sports updates, or TV—focus on complete love and strength in relationships.
