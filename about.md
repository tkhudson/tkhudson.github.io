Hello, I'm Tyler Hudson, a passionate DevSecOps enthusiast with a deep interest in cloud security and software development. My journey in technology has equipped me with extensive experience in various tools and software, enabling me to excel in designing, implementing, and managing complex systems.

In my professional career, I've worked extensively with cloud technologies, particularly focusing on security aspects. I have a background in I.T. consulting, where I've designed, installed, and monitored infrastructure using Ubiquiti devices, and I’ve also developed full-stack web applications utilizing modern technologies such as Docker, Terraform, and Azure. Currently, I’m engaged in exciting projects, including a real-time messaging app and a web app with Flask, which I’m deploying using a CI/CD pipeline and Kubernetes.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I have a strong passion for gaming and game development. I’ve teamed up with my brother to establish our own game development studio. We are currently working on our first game using Godot and C#, diving into the creative and technical challenges of game design and development.

Whether it’s securing cloud environments, developing innovative software solutions, or creating engaging gaming experiences, I’m driven by a passion for technology and a commitment to excellence.
