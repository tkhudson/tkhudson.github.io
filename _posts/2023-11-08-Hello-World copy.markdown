## Flask Web app that utilizes DevOps tools and practices:

This project in planning/testing phase at the moment. You can find another page on the channel I will update which is the Projects page. However, here in the blog area, I will give updates as well. Anyways I have a project up my sleeve that I am working on building out and below is some info I have so far.

Come ride out the journey with me! I appreciate you stopping by and I will be posting on my LinkedIn as well!

## The Plan

I will develop a web app with Flask, a web framework for Python, using HTML and CSS (some python as well of course). I will be implementing a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) process with Jenkins for deploying the Flask web app to a Kubernetes cluster as well.

Tools the project will use (not limited... may change):
- Git
- Github
- Flask
- - - Python, HTML, CSS
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Azure

I am hoping this helps demonstrate my knowledge over DevOps practices.

## Signing Off

Thank you all.

Best regards,
Tyler
