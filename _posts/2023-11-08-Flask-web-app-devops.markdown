## In the works:

Got a project in planning/testing phase at the moment. I will develop a web app with Flask, a web framework for Python, using HTML and CSS (some python as well of course). I will be implementing a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) process with Jenkins for deploying the Flask web app to a Kubernetes cluster as well.

Tools the project will use (not limited... may change):
- Git
- Github
- Flask
    - Python, HTML, CSS
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Azure

I am hoping this helps demonstrate my knowledge over DevOps practices.
